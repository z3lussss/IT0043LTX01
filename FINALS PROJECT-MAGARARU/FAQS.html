                    <p>My experiences as a gamer significantly influence my approach to game development. Playing a wide
                        variety of games helps me understand what makes a game enjoyable and engaging from a player's
                        perspective. </p>

                    <p>What do you think is the most important skill for a game developer?</p>

                    <p>
                        the most important skill for a game developer is a strong foundation in programming coupled with
                        creativity. Technical skills are crucial because they enable you to implement complex game
                        mechanics and solve technical problems. However, creativity is equally important as it drives
                        innovation in game design, helping to create unique and compelling gameplay experiences that
                        stand out in a crowded market.

                    <p>Why did you choose IT with a focus on game development?</p>

                <div class="FAQS__answer">
                    <p>I chose IT with a focus on game development because I've always been passionate about video
                        games, both playing and understanding how they are made. This specialization allows me to
                        combine my technical skills and creativity to craft engaging gaming experiences.</p>
